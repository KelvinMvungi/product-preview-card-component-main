## My process

Started with the HTML first, later came to the css and did some minor edit on the HTML to get the layout correct for desktop design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

What I learned in this section is cool new ways to create and initialize a repository from command line plus recap of all the basic stuffs of HTML and CSS.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) - This helped me for some HTML markup. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand center items. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
